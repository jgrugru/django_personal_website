					<h5>What I Do</h5>
					<hr>
          <p>Fresh out of college, I began managing code pipelines for the largest tech compamy in Oklahoma. I worked with developers to automate steps in the CI/CD pipeline, creating over 100 builds in Teamcity, utilizing Docker and Powershell scripting.</p>
          <p>My career has continued in the devops space. Now I get to use Python on a daily basis, automating security tasks and integrating tools. </p>

					<h5>My Experience as a Developer</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Ever since the Covid pandemic swept through the US shortly after the ides of March, I have taken time to break past surface level development knowledge. To follow that statement up: who is to say I broke through? Regardless, I am trying to swim in this newly found software ocean.</p>
					<p>Thans to social distancing and flattening the curve, I have dug deep into Python and Django, replicating linux commands on Windows, creating various webscraping projects and a ticket tracking system. Checkout my <a href='https://github.com/jgrugru' target="_blank">github</a>!</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Projects that give immediate feedback and allow for interactions with other humans are where I learn best. As a full-blown extrovert, the human element is crucial when learning. Covid, please let up.</p>
          <p>While that is the case, I have discoved that I am extremely motivated to learn about certain topics regardless of who is involved. Django is one of them. I have fallen in love with the depth of Django's capabilities. I feel like it was built for me: ease of testing and immediate feedback.</p>
